                    I’m a young engineer trying to make my mark in the industry. I’ve always had a keen interest in computer engineering from a young age. 
                    At first it started with hardware but as I grew up I became more interested in the software aspect of Computer Science. 
                    Even though I was born in Salem Massachusetts, I grew up in Dakar Senegal.  
                    Growing up in a third world country, I had a lot of time and that pushed me to follow my passion (even with limited resources). 
                    I furthered my journey at Salem State University and graduated in 2019 with a B.S in computer science. 
                    I currently work on contract as a Software Developer at Slaymasters. At my current position I’ve built a Dashboard from scratch using React.JS, Postgres, GitHub and Vercel. 
                    The application manages assignments, letting managers assign them to anyone and giving user many tools to submit them. 
                    Currently I’m working on developing a chat-app for the users. I’m also working with a team to build another dashboard using Typescript to manage data for their mobile app. 
                    I‘ve also worked in the field as an iOS Developer at a company named Distaff and an IT/Communication Intern for a couple months with CDX Analytics before being let go due to Covid-19. 
                    I’ve also spent four years as a Sales Associate at for Marshalls. 
                    In this role I was valued as the employee overseeing the cleaning & organization of the Shoe Department assisting in keeping track of stock and also in charge training future employees. 
                    I look forward to using all my previous experiences to help me in my future endeavors
