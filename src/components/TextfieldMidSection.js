                    I’m a young engineer trying to make my mark in the industry. I’ve always had a keen interest in computer engineering from a young age. 
                    At first it started with hardware but as I grew up I became more interested in the software aspect of Computer Science. 
                    Even though I was born in Salem Massachusetts, I grew up in Dakar Senegal.
                     Growing up in a third world country, I had a lot of time and that pushed me to follow my passion (even with limited resources).  
                     I furthered my journey at Salem State University and graduated in 2019 with a B.S in computer science. I currently work as a iOS intern for start-up called DiStaff. 
                     There I’m tasked with developing the best possible developer experience for mobile engineers by ensuring our tools are effective, efficient and easy to use. 
                     I collaborate with other engineers and leadership to build, optimize and maintain the CI/CD systems. 
                     I’m currently tasked with the job of building an Android version of the iOS native application which we plan on releasing in a couple months. 
                     I‘ve also worked in the field as an IT/Communication Intern for a couple months with a company named CDX Analytics before being let go due to Covid-19. 
                     In this role I assisted in maintenance and upgrading the IT infrastructure of the office. Aided in the development of a new Analysis Request App designed to replace older inefficient model. 
                     We also revamped another application called the CDX Results Database app in concert with the scientists. I’ve also spent four years as a Sales Associate at for Marshalls. 
                     In this role I was valued as the employee overseeing the cleaning & organization of the Shoe Department. assisting in keeping track of stock and also in charge training future employees. 
                     I look forward to using all my previous experiences to help me in my future endeavors
