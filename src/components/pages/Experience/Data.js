    description2: 'Slaymaster Dashboard: February 2022 - Present \n• Developed a full stack application using React.JS, CSS and Supabase as the backend. The Dashboard was built as a tool for the influencers in the Slaymasters community to use to make their jobs easier. The whole app was developed by me and is being maintained by me \n• On the top of the dashboard is a Tolstoy video giving the user the ability to be briefed by the manager but also have an interactive conversation. \n• The dashboard allows the Manager to assign assignments to any influencer and displays it in a table. The table gives the manager the ability to add a link to the particular assignment for more details making the row clickable. If the row doesn’t contain a link the row is not hyperlinked. It also contains logic to read the assignment date and compare it to the current date to see if the assignment is late, if true the row is red. \n• The dashboard has a Google calendar with lists of notable events the community. It also has multiple different tools like the ability to go live using restream and to refer friends or leave feedbacks using type form. \n• It also features a get help button which sends you to your email so you can communicate with support and another button which send the influencer to Slaymaster official Amazon wishlist for recommended products. \n• Another tool is the ability to upload videos straight to the Vimeo account of the manager and files/images to Supabase directly from the dashboard application. \n• Below the tools is a “How to use Dashboard” tutorial videos for users and training videos for the influencers. \n\n Slaymaster Dashboard Chat App: June 2022 - Present \n• Currently developing a whole new tool called Slaymaster Chat which will enable user to communicate with each other and add multiple different influencers into rooms. \n• The application is being built using React.JS, CSS and Supabase as the backend. In supabase I have developed a couple functions, triggers and listeners(on the frontend side) to make a lot of the processes more seamless and improving the automation of the backend work. \n• Very similar to the way Microsoft Teams and Slack functions. \n• The application is still in the early stages but should be released by September 2022.',
