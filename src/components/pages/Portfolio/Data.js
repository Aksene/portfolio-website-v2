The Dashboard was built as a tool for the influencers in the Slaymasters community to use to make their jobs easier. The whole app was developed by me and is being maintained by me  \n• The dashboard allows the Manager to assign assignments to any influencer and displays it in a table. The table gives the manager the ability to add a link to the particular assignment for more details making the row clickable. If the row doesn’t contain a link the row is not hyperlinked. It also contains logic to read the assignment date and compare it to the current date to see if the assignment is late, if true the row is red. \n• Currently developing a whole new tool called Slaymaster Chat which will enable user to communicate with each other and add multiple different influencers into rooms.  \n• Click the image for more!',

On the bottom of the screen is a "now playing bar" which shows what song is playing or nothing if no song is playing. You can also either skip to the next song or go back to the previous one with the help of two buttons. The second tab on the other hand is the now playing screen, which shows you the details clearly. On the bottom of it is the queue showing the non played songs in shuffled order. You can also like the song through a like button which increments the count on the database.',
